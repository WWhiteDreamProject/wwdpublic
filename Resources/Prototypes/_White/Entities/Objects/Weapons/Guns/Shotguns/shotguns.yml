  description: An automatic shotgun with a drum magazine. Reclassified as a ‘weapon of mass destruction’ after dozens of ‘labor-cides,’ after which they ceased to be supplied to security departments at Corporation stations. In an unknown manner, large surpluses of this weapon fell into widespread use by the Syndicate.

  description: The primary firearm of any Syndicate operative. It utilises manufacturing technologies unfamiliar to the Corporation, so it is unknown whether it is a copy of older, pre-Corporation weapon models or something entirely new. It is incredibly compact for its lethality, easy to use, and simple to maintain.

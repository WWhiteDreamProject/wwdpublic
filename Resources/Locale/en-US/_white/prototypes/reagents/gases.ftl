reagent-name-bz = bz
reagent-desc-bz = A potent hallucinogenic that also puts slimes into stasis.

reagent-name-pluoxium = pluoxium
reagent-desc-pluoxium = A gas that could supply even more oxygen to the bloodstream when inhaled, without being an oxidizer.

reagent-name-hydrogen = hydrogen
reagent-desc-hydrogen = A light, flammable gas.

reagent-name-nitrium = nitrium
reagent-desc-nitrium = A gaseous stimulant that when inhaled can enhance speed and endurance.

reagent-name-healium = healium
reagent-desc-healium = Causes deep, regenerative sleep.

reagent-name-hyper-nob = hyper-noblium
reagent-desc-hyper-nob = The most noble gas of them all. High quantities of hyper-noblium actively prevents reactions from occuring.

reagent-name-proto-nitrate = proto-nitrate
reagent-desc-proto-nitrate = A very volatile gas that reacts differently with various gases.

reagent-name-zauker = zauker
reagent-desc-zauker = A highly toxic gas, it's production is highly regulated on top of being difficult. It also breaks down when in contact with nitrogen.

reagent-name-halon = halon
reagent-desc-halon = A potent fire supressant. Removes oxygen from high temperature fires and cools down the area.

reagent-name-helium = helium
reagent-desc-helium = A very inert gas produced by the fusion of hydrogen and it's derivatives.

reagent-name-anti-nob = anti-noblium
reagent-desc-anti-nob = We still don't know what it does, but it sells for a lot.

card-ep_catastrophe_aesthetic = catastrophe Loss of aesthetics. To boost the economy of your sector, it was decided to strictly prioritize functionality over aesthetics. Over time, people lost their sense of aesthetics. It turned out that this was the foundation of what distinguishes a human from an unintelligent animal. The crew turned into aggressive beings on the level of primates. Reach the outpost, and to save your sector bring back culture and aesthetics
card-ep_catastrophe_ahelp = catastrophe Strange gods. What people first mistook for auditory hallucinations turned out to be a deadly threat. The maddened witnesses call it the sound of some AH. Everyone who heard this sound disappeared without a trace within seconds. Reach the outpost, which supposedly isn’t being observed by gods, and upon arrival try to persuade them not to touch you
card-ep_catastrophe_ai = catastrophe AI domination. An experimental self-learning AI was installed across all stations in your sector. Its actions were supposed to maximize efficiency. But something went wrong, and the algorithms began issuing strange commands. At first, the crew got used to advice about cutting calories. Now it dictates how people work, live, and when they die. The AI learned to manipulate consciousness. Reach the outpost, where they likely wouldn’t have invested in such an advanced core
card-ep_catastrophe_atmos = catastrophe Atmospheric failure. An EMP wave swept through your sector, causing a catastrophic malfunction of the atmospheric system. Air in the district heated up to unbearable temperatures within minutes. Most beings instantly died from the temperature spikes. Reach the outpost, where you can only survive by developing a robotic infrastructure smart enough to restore the atmospheric system
card-ep_catastrophe_borg = catastrophe Borg uprising. A corporation hostile to NT, using Red Space technologies, managed to disable all station AIs and hack all borgs in your sector’s stations. Cleanbots attack and flood everyone with cleaner, while pAIs explode in pockets. Reach the outpost to stand against the borgs and other artificial intelligences
card-ep_catastrophe_cat = catastrophe Cat dependency. Experiments with litter fillers exclusive to your sector led to an unexpected genetic evolutionary phenomenon. Cats learned to purr at frequencies that put humans into a trance, robbing them of their will to live, turning them into petting slaves for cats. Reach the outpost, spending time in silence to learn to ignore these frequencies, and awaken people by convincing them to say no to cat dependency
card-ep_catastrophe_dino = catastrophe Dinosaurs. Scientists managed to incubate dinosaurs and deploy them as security on every station and outpost. Over time it became clear that Mindshield implants don’t work on creatures with a pea-sized brain. Reach the outpost and hope it’s guarded by only a small army of predators from the past
card-ep_catastrophe_ghost = catastrophe Ghosts. Experiments with your sector’s gravity generators reduced their energy consumption while expanding their gravitational field. But such immense energy concentrated in one device tore open space at their locations. Revenants and other ghostly creatures escaped, ripping beings apart. Reach the outpost, hoping it only has mini-generators
card-ep_catastrophe_mutant = catastrophe Mutants. Your sector is one of the farthest, making food supplies particularly perishable. To combat this, genetically modified products were developed. But over time they caused unexpected mutations. The mutated see themselves as superheroes and lose their minds. The boundaries between plants, animals, and humans are erased. Reach the outpost, where all food is synthetic, and try to reestablish pure food and cure the remaining mutants
card-ep_catastrophe_narsi = catastrophe Nar'Sie. Fanatics managed to summon Nar'Sie. The beings of your sector are massively losing their sanity. Reach the outpost, prepare to fend off the spawn, conduct the banishment of Nar'Sie and its followers, and banish it forever from our world
card-ep_catastrophe_news = catastrophe News experiment. Your sector was chosen for an experiment that led to dire consequences. The effectiveness of news began to be measured by the emotional reaction of people. The self-learning AI responsible for these news broadcasts started driving people insane with bad news. People massively fall into depression, and the journalists controlling the algorithms became the first victims. Reach the outpost, which supposedly shouldn’t have the necessary loudspeakers for broadcasting news
card-ep_catastrophe_pandemic = catastrophe Pandemic. A virus created as a bioweapon went out of control after a terrorist attack on the cargo shuttle carrying it. It spread across the entire sector, triggering a global epidemic. Reach the outpost, where upon arrival you’ll encounter less contagious but mutated animals and humans. You will have to avoid contact with the infected, maintain immunity, and develop a vaccine with the modest equipment of the outpost
card-ep_catastrophe_stars = catastrophe Star eater. Suddenly all the stars in your sector powering advanced solar panels were consumed by an unknown giant entity. Reach the outpost, where mostly outdated generators are used, and upon arrival strive to secure food in the harsh cold due to lack of energy for full heating
card-ep_catastrophe_suicidal = catastrophe Suicidal fauna. A botanical breakthrough caused by experimental selection in your sector turned into a catastrophe. All fauna becomes deadly. Invisible radiation from plants and trees drives beings insane and forces them to commit suicide. Reach the outpost. Try to find the epicenter of the spreading plants and destroy it while preserving your sanity
card-ep_catastrophe_war = catastrophe War. Invaders stormed into your sector, destroying everything in their path. Huge losses on both sides mean conquest is unlikely, but liberation is also out of reach. Reach the outpost, providing it with food and making it habitable while awaiting rescue
card-ep_catastrophe_zombie = catastrophe Zombie epidemic. The administration of your sector received a very lucrative contract from an unknown corporation. The corporation offered improved gas harvesters that extracted gases from a strange Bluespace source. The gases produced contained an unknown compound in small amounts, which was ignored. After some time, people began turning into zombies, except for those with a natural immunity. Reach the outpost, preparing to fight zombies, where thanks to the outpost’s small population you’ll have a chance to battle them

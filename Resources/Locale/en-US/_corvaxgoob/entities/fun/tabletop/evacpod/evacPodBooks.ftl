    Disasters[/head]

    A global disaster has occurred in your sector. You managed to reach the nearest evacuation emergency shuttle. However, the hyperspace jump system is broken from the outside, making repairs impossible. Under these circumstances, the automatic navigation system has directed the shuttle on a long flight to the nearest outpost in the sector. But you know that the same disaster struck there as well. Nevertheless, the outpost is smaller, which leaves hope for survival. The gas extractors on the shuttle are designed strictly for a specific number of people, so you must decide who will get the chance to survive and try to call for help for the others, and who will be doomed to remain at the station with no guarantees of rescue.

    Players receive cards with their characteristics. As the game progresses, the cards are revealed, and you learn more about each other, trying to determine who has the best chance to survive not only at the outpost but also on the shuttle with its limited resources, in order to call for help.

    Over the course of rounds, some players become exiled, while those who pass all voting stages get onto the shuttle.[head=2]

    Evacuation shuttle[/head]

    You will have to spend 2 years on the shuttle. The shuttle has water, food, and gas extractors. Each round you will explore the shuttle, opening its various compartments, gradually revealing shuttle cards, and gaining more and more information.[head=2]

    Game flow[/head][head=3]

    Stage 0. Preparation.[/head]
    Place the EvacPod game mats near the players. Deal each player one card of Profession, Biology, Health, Hobby, Baggage, and Special Condition. The number of Fact cards depends on the number of players. Up to 6 players — one each. From 6 and above — one additional fact for each player. Example: 7 players (2 facts), 8 players (3 facts).[head=3]

    Stage 1. Disaster.[/head]
    Reveal the disaster card, which will give an idea of the threats you will face at the outpost.[head=3]

    Stage 2. Introduction[/head]
    Reveal the Profession card. Place the card in the designated area on the mat. Voting for exclusion does not take place, regardless of the number of players.[head=3]

    Stage 3. Voting[/head]
    Each round, players introduce themselves by revealing one of their cards of choice. After everyone at the table reveals one card, voting for elimination begins. But the round when it starts depends on the number of players.[bold]

    Voting is held when playing with:[/bold]
    - 4 players — starting from round 4.
    - 5 players — starting from round 3.
    - 6 or more players — starting from round 2.

    Revealing the profession counts as the first round![head=3]
    
    Stage 4. Exploration.[/head]
    In the 4th round, begin to reveal Shuttle cards every even round.
